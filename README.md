Quiz.java utilises a constructor which inputs a char array as an argument. Quiz.java contains an array with the correct answers
(A, B, C, D) for each question. The two arrays are compared and the total correct and incorrect answers are displayed.
An array is created which has the incorrect question numbers and this is also returned to the user.

QuizDemo.java utilises the scanner to input 10 answers (A, B, C, D) into an array. If the user enters an invalid character,
they will be prompted to enter a valid input via a loop. the Quiz constructor is instantiated so the previously mentioned tasks
can be executed.
